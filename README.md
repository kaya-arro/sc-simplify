# What it does

## Behavior

Reads a simplicial complex from `stdin` and prints an equivalent simplified complex or pair.

The primary motivation is to accelerate homology computations for extremely large and highly non-minimal complexes in a memory-efficient manner.

## Niche

`sc-simplify` is fast, but so are other programs for homology computations. Even more than speed, `sc-simplify` aims for *memory efficiency*.

Since the mid-to-late-2000s, the fastest algorithms for calculating the homology of simpicial complexes have preprocessed their input using the [discrete Morse theory](https://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s48forman.pdf) (DMT) developed by Forman and built upon by many others. A major drawback of DMT algorithms is that they typically must calculate all of the simplices of a simplicial complex before they can be simplifying it to calculate its homology. When the input complex is large and has high dimension, this makes calculations with DMT completely intractible.

Because `sc-simplify` does not use DMT and only needs to calculate the edges of a simplicial complex (once the facets have been specified by the user), it uses orders of magnitude less memory than DMT algorithms while still being very fast: in my testing, `sc-simplify` is up to twice as fast as the DMT-based program [Perseus](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/).

# Usage

## Options

For a comprehensive explanation of the available options, see `sc-simplify --help` or `man ./sc-simplify.1.gz`.

## Input

### Formatting input

The program reads its input from `stdin`. Each line is a facet presented as a space-separated list of vertices labeled by natural numbers less than $2^{32}$. The program is tolerant of excess whitespace. If non-empty non-maximal faces are included in the input, bugs may or may not arise; in this case, you should enable the`-c`/`--check-input` flag to ensure correct behavior.

Example input not requiring `--check-input`:

```text
0   1     3 2
4 1    3


2 5
```

 Example input requiring `--check-input`:

```text
0 1 2 3
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 0
1 3 4
0 1 4
```

Input that contains characters other than numerals, spaces, and newlines will cause `sc-simplify` to panic.

### Loading input

For those unused to the terminal: since `sc-simplify` reads from `stdin`, you can redirect your input from a file with `<`, pipe the input from the output of another command with `|`, or enter the input by hand, signalling its termination with `^D` (Ctrl + D) after a newline:

```shell
sc-simplify -NP1 < my-complex.sc > pinched.sc
sc-factory.sh | sc-simplify -c > checked.sc
sc-simplify -p > circle.sc
0 1
1 2
2 3
0 3
^D
```

## Output

`sc-simplify` prints its output to `stdout`, so if you wish to save the output as a file, you should redirect `stdout` using `>` (see the examples above and below). If `stderr` is a terminal and the  `-q`/`--quiet` flag is not enabled, `sc-simplify` prints progress indicators to `stderr`.

By default, the output has the same formatting as the input with the simplified complex and its contractible subcomplex delineated by a blank line.

Alternatively, the `-x`/`--xml` flag can be enabled to yield a `.xml` file that can be loaded by GAP's `simpcomp` package with the `SCLoadXML` command:

```console
$ sc-simplify < my-complex.sc -px > simplified.xml.sc
$ gap
gap> LoadPackage("simpcomp");;
gap> x := SCLoadXML("simplified.xml.sc");;
gap> SCHomologyClassic(x);
```

Since GAP `simpcomp` does not compute relative homology, you should usually use the `-p`/`--no-pair` flag when preparing a complex as input for `simpcomp`.

If you would like to use the program with Sage, functions for importing and exporting simplicial complexes in `sc-simplify`'s format to and from Sage are provided in the file `Python/sc_io.py`. For example, the `read_sc_pair` function can be used like so:

```python
X, C = read_sc_pair("simplified.sc")
X.homology(subcomplex=C, enlarge=False, base_ring=QQ)
```

# Algorithm

The following steps are the default algorithm; they can be adjusted by passing various flags to the program. See `sc-simplify --help` for details.

1. Take the ÄŒech nerve of the input iteratively until no more simplifications occur and the dimension of the complex is less than or equal to that of its nerve.

2. Use the link condition to identify edges that can be contracted without changing the homotopy type of the complex and contract them. Call the resulting complex $X$.

3. Construct a large contractible subcomplex $C$ of $X$.

4. Remove the facets of $C$ from $X$ and take the intersection of this smaller complex with $C$ to obtain a new, smaller pair $(A, B)$ with the same homotopy type as the original input (but in which $B$ may not be contractible and therefore $A$ may be of a different homotopy type from the input).

At this point, the idea is to feed the output of `sc-simplify` into another program, such as Sage, to calculate the relative homology of the pair, which will agree with the homology of the original input. In a future update, `sc-simplify` will be able to calculate the homology itself without the need for an auxiliary program for the final step.

# Installation

## Dependencies

- Rust

## Install process

1. If necessary, install Rust.
   
   - You can your operating system's package manager or Rust's [official installation shell script](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):
   
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. If necessary (e.g. if you did not use the official installation script), update Rust to the latest edition with `rustup upgrade`.

3. Clone/download this repository.

4. Execute `cargo +nightly build -r` in the root directory of the repository.
   
   - The current version of `sc-simplify` uses some nightly features of Rust, but this will be changed in a future release.

5. Optional: copy or link `sc-simplify.1.gz` into `/usr/share/man/man1/` so that `man sc-simplify` brings up the manual (see below for how to do this from the terminal).

6. The binary can be found at `target/release/sc-simplify`. With your shell in the root directory of the repository, link to the binary from your `PATH` with
   
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/sc-simplify /usr/bin/
   ```
   
   If you plan to delete or move `target/release/sc-simplify`, make a hardlink by omitting the `-s` flag or copy the binary with
   
   ```bash
   sudo cp target/release/sc-simplify /usr/bin/
   ```
   
   or generally do whatever you want with the binary: it's yours! If you don't want to include it in your `PATH`, you can still run it by specifying the path to the binary in your command line.

## Portability

Since the purpose of this program is efficiency, the `-C target-cpu=native`  `rustc` compile flag is enabled in `.cargo/config.toml`. This means that you may not be able to run the produced binary on a machine other than the one on which you built it (or at least a machine with the same microarchitecture). If you would like a more portable but possibly slower version of the program, comment out this flag.

# Development plans and hopes and dreams

- [ ] Possibly eventually implement integral homology.

# Limitations

This package is not intended to be a general toolkit for working with simplicial complexes. It is focused on the single goal of filling what I perceived as a gap in the functionality of available software: *memory efficient* algorithms for efficiently reducing complexes to accelerate calculations of homotopy invariants.

Other tools exist for more general manipulations of simplicial complexes. A highly non-exhausitive list of these includes the `simplicial_topology` Rust crate, the `simpcomp` GAP package, and the `sage.topology.simplicial_complex` Sage/Python module.
